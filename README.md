# Automated Sales Prediction for E-commerce

## Overview

This project aims to create a system that predicts weekly sales for an e-commerce platform using machine learning. The system retrieves data from a MySQL database, replicates it to Google Sheets via Docker and Airbyte, and authenticates the connection through Google Cloud Platform. The machine learning model is trained on historical sales data to forecast future sales.
